# Our website
We're going to move this to Gitlab ideally, however, we need to continue working on the aesthethic for the website.
We also need to create some form of CI/CD, aka continuous integration and continuous deployment. 

## why CI/CD?

The last website experienced a "lost of history", many images drawn by former watercress artist, instant is gone. 
We weren't able to secure the protection of the all of the lost data. 
Eventually, we will make gallery, indepedent posts by various crew, etc however, we need some form of version control to preserve all that data.
we need some way to actually engineer and maintain the website regardless of who's in charge of it.


## what if I find a problem on the website?

Please make an Github issue, or make a trello task here: https://trello.com/b/t11Mrj8D/coding-department
The programming department is a busy department and sometimes looses track of things so make sure you make note of any big issues you find

## May I work on it?

Yes, any studio member can work on the website now.
