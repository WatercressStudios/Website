# This is the watercress website
We're going to move this to Gitlab ideally, however, we need to continue working on the aesthethic for the website.
We also need to create some form of CI/CD, aka continuous integration and continuous deployment. 

## why CI/CD?

The last website experienced a "lost of history", many images drawn by former watercress artist, instant is gone. 
We weren't able to secure the protection of the all of the lost data. 
Eventually, we will make gallery, indepedent posts by various crew, etc however, we need some form of version control to preserve all that data.
we need some way to actually engineer and maintain the website regardless of who's in charge of it.


## what if I find a problem on the website?

Please make an Github issue, or make a trello task here: https://trello.com/b/t11Mrj8D/coding-department
The programming department is a busy department and sometimes looses track of things so make sure you make note of any big issues you find

## When will the website be available for launch?

That decision will be left to the marketing department, assuming we're close to the final design of it 

## Can I work on it?

Sure, however, this github page is seperate from the domain and unfortuantely you cannot run php code via github pages. So, you would need to fork and create a server to run this php code to properly develop on it.
Only the programming department and the marketing department have access the dev build of https://watercressstudios.com/
If you want access to the website dev build, ask Wolfie or Alch, Happiness+ will grant you access once they are fine with it. 
please don't break anything on there though, we do have github in case you break something, but deploying it to fix something is the nuclear option

If you have any other questions, please direct them to Wolf and Alch.
